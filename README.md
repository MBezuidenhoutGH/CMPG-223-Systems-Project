Created a program that uses a database we created, the main focus of the project was the creation of the database and being able to use it in a basic C# .NET WinForms application. My main responsibility in the group was to code everything up in the application because I had a unique view of how to go about writing SQL so that everything makes logical sense and nothing gets left out.
